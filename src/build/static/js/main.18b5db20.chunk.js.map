Its backwater trips, houseboat stays, and serene beauty attract a fair number of people to its territory. In fact, it is the most popular place to experience some offbeat Kerala backwaters. Lord Curzon’s depiction of Alleppey as the Venice of the East is not hyperbole. Alleppey houseboat vacation is what people look for on their visit to Alleppey. There are expanses of paddy fields, quaint chapels, interesting fishing villages, and lakes filled with water lilies which make Allepey one of the best tourist places in Kerala for 3 days trip itinerary.The fascination of Keralites with coconut and banana leaves in their food will prove to be a good experiment for you if you have never had it before.

There is a lot to do; choose from boating, cruising, Kumarakom houseboat stay, and fishing. Kumarakom holds a special spot in the list of best of Kerala’s sightseeing places. The tempting waterways, decorated lakes, aromatic coconut grooves, fresh paddy fields, thick mangrove forests, delightful authentic food, and unpolluted freshness of the air add to the list. Also, Kumarakom’s houseboat stay offers a lot more solitude and privacy as compared to Alleppey.
